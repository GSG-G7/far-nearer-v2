## **The Challenges** :warning:

- The End user needs a way to report potentially empty buildings in their area so that they can bring them into community ownership before they are bought by commercial buyers.
- The Product owner needs a way to connect with these communities and gather the initial data so that they can run the initial investigations with the communities.

## **The Solution** :bulb:

FAR NEARER website enables users to report about any empty buildings and the community members can access this data with provided credentials.
